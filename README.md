Expense Tracking System made in C++ language.
It is used to track expenses.
Functions included are:
Add expense, View all expenses, Calculate total expenses, Delete expense, Edit expense, Exit.
Firstly i made a structure named expense in which i declared my attributes(category,amount,description,date).
Then i made a function to display mainmenu.
Then i made functions to store my expenses using filing library.
Then i made functions for all the options that i have included and added the functionality that they are performing.
At the end i used switch and case statements to call my functions as per the choice entered.
